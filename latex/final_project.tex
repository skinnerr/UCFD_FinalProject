PHASTA begins execution at `main`, located in `phSolver/[in]compressible`, depending on which branch is desired. This function initializes MPI, and then calls `phasta`, located in `/phSolver/common`. Here, inputs are read and computed in `input`, and then the solver is run by calling `proces`, a Fortran routine. Within `proces`, `gendat` generates geometry and BC data.
