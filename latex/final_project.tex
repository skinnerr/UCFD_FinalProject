\section{Initial Outline of PHASTA}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PHASTA begins execution at |main|, located in |phSolver/[in]compressible|, depending on which branch is desired. This function initializes MPI, and then calls |phasta|, located in |/phSolver/common|. Here, inputs are read and computed in |input|, and then the solver is run by calling |proces|, a Fortran routine. Within |proces|, |gendat| generates geometry and BC data.

Routines followed by an asterisk (\ra) are outlined in further detail separately.

{\huge \color{red!75!black} INCOMPRESSIBLE ONLY}, and we ignore cardiovascular impedance and RCR boundary stuff.

\end{outline}

Numerical solution of the time-integrated unsteady Navier-Stokes equations occurs within |itrdrv|. Working arrays are listed in 
\begin{outline}[deep]
\1 |itrdrv|
	\2 |initTimeSeries| --- initialize time series collection to |varts.*.dat| files using |xyzts.dat| input
	\2 initialize |istep| and |ifuncs(:)| to zero, and set |yold = y| and |acold = ac|
	\2 |initEQS| --- initialize equation solver (look into this later \ra ?)
	\2 |do itsq = 1, ntseq| --- main loop over time sequences
		\3 set |itseq = itsq|

			\4 calculate $\alpha_m$, $\alpha_f$, and $\gamma$ as functions of $\rho_\infty$

			\4 ...
			\4 ...

\section{Life's Persistent PHASTA Questions}
\begin{outline}[deep]
	\1 Is |qold|, allocated in |readnblk.f| ever deallocated? Can't find it.
	\1 Why do most of the time step parameters have dimension |MAXTS|?
		\2 It also seems that some parameters are indexed by |itseq|, but don't change from step to step.
